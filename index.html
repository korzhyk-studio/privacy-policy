  Privacy Policy

Effective Date: 06.08.2025

1. General Provisions

We respect the privacy of all users of our applications, especially children. Our applications are intended for children aged 3 years and older and strictly comply with applicable international and national data protection laws, including:

Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA, USA);
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR, EU);

We strive to ensure safe, transparent and minimized data processing.

2. Data Collection

Personal data that we DO NOT collect:

username, address, email;
precise geolocation data;
unique identifiers that allow you to identify the child.

Analytics and anonymized data:

The application may use third-party services (e.g. Google Firebase, Google Analytics for Firebase) to collect anonymized information for the following purposes:

improving application performance;
diagnosing errors and crashes;
displaying ads that meet children's standards.

Such data may include:

device type, model, operating system;
interface language and country;
length of game sessions;
generalized technical logs (e.g. error codes).

We do not use this data to identify individuals and do not profile users.

Contact via feedback:

If you contact us directly (e.g. by email), we will use the data you provide only to respond to your request. The data is not stored longer than necessary to resolve the request and is not transferred to third parties.

3. In-app purchases

In-app purchases are processed through Google Play Billing. We do not have access to payment details (e.g. card number), but we may have access to:

Google account name;
Email address;
Purchase information (transaction ID, amount, date).

This data is used exclusively to confirm the transaction and provide paid content.

4. Advertising

Google AdMob is used to display ads. When children use our products, we:

5. Processing of children's personal information

We do not collect personal information directly from children. If such information is provided as part of a request from a parent or guardian, we use it only to:

provide the requested support;
verify the request;
protect the rights and safety of the child.

Such information may only be transferred in the following cases:

as required by law or court;
to ensure user safety;
to protect against fraud;
at the request of law enforcement agencies within the framework of applicable law.

6. Age determination

When the application is first launched, the user is prompted to specify their age:

if less than 13 years is specified, the child mode is automatically enabled, blocking personalized advertising and other functions that require data collection;
if 13 years and older is specified, we assume that the entered age is correct.

If you are a parent or legal guardian and believe that the child has entered an incorrect age, please contact us and we will delete the collected data if necessary.

7. Rights of data subjects

Right to restriction of processing;
Right to object to processing;
Right to withdraw consent at any time;
Right to lodge a complaint with a data protection authority.

We will review and implement your request within 30 days of identity verification, unless:

your identity cannot be verified;
the request jeopardizes the rights of other users;
there are legitimate grounds for storing the data;
the request is excessive or unfounded.

8. Registration and accounts

The Application does not provide for registration, account creation or authorization. Accordingly, we do not process:

logins;

email addresses for registration purposes.

9. Data Security

We use technical and organizational security measures, including:

SDK-level encryption;
use of official and trusted services (Google, Firebase, AdMob);
