  <h1>Privacy Policy — MyGame</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 06.08.2025</p>

  <h2>1. General Provisions</h2>
  <p>We respect the privacy of all users of our applications, especially children. Our applications are intended for children aged 3 years and older and strictly comply with applicable international and national data protection laws, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA, USA);</li>
    <li>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR, EU);</li>
    <li>Law of Ukraine "On the Protection of Personal Data";</li>
    <li>Other applicable rules governing the processing of personal data.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We strive to ensure safe, transparent and minimized data processing.</p>

  <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
  <p><strong>Personal data that we DO NOT collect:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Username, address, email;</li>
    <li>Precise geolocation data;</li>
    <li>Unique identifiers that allow you to identify the child.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Analytics and anonymized data:</strong> The application may use third-party services (e.g. Google Firebase, Google Analytics for Firebase) to collect anonymized information for purposes such as improving application performance, diagnosing errors, and displaying child-appropriate ads.</p>
  <p>Such data may include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Device type, model, operating system;</li>
    <li>Interface language and country;</li>
    <li>Length of game sessions;</li>
    <li>Generalized technical logs (e.g. error codes).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not use this data to identify individuals and do not profile users.</p>

  <h2>3. In-app purchases</h2>
  <p>In-app purchases are processed through Google Play Billing. We do not have access to payment details, but we may access:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Google account name;</li>
    <li>Email address;</li>
    <li>Purchase information (transaction ID, amount, date).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This data is used exclusively to confirm the transaction and provide paid content. More information: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a></p>

  <h2>4. Advertising</h2>
  <p>Google AdMob is used to display ads. For children:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Personalized advertising is disabled;</li>
    <li>Child-directed mode is enabled;</li>
    <li>Only certified ad networks that comply with COPPA are used.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not allow personal data collection for ads.</p>

  <h2>5. Processing of children's personal information</h2>
  <p>We do not collect personal information directly from children. If provided by a parent or guardian, it is used only for support, verification, or safety purposes, and may be transferred only as required by law or to protect users.</p>

  <h2>6. Age determination</h2>
  <p>When first launching the application, the user specifies their age:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If under 13 — child mode is enabled (no personalized ads, limited data collection).</li>
    <li>If 13 or older — we assume the entered age is correct.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Rights of data subjects</h2>
  <p>You or your legal representative have rights to access, update, erase, restrict processing, object to processing, withdraw consent, and file complaints to authorities. Requests are processed within 30 days unless identity cannot be verified or there are legal grounds for refusal.</p>

  <h2>8. Registration and accounts</h2>
  <p>The application does not provide registration or account creation, so we do not process logins, passwords, or registration emails.</p>

  <h2>9. Data Security</h2>
  <p>We use technical and organizational measures, including SDK-level encryption, trusted services (Google, Firebase, AdMob), restricted access to data, and regular app updates.</p>

  <h2>10. Parental Control</h2>
  <p>Parents are encouraged to supervise the first launch and age selection. If incorrect data is entered, contact us for correction or deletion.</p>

  <h2>11. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>We are not responsible for incorrect ages entered by users or third-party service actions beyond our control.</p>

  <h2>12. Policy Updates</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy. In case of significant changes, users will be notified through an app update or Google Play store description.</p>

  <h2>13. Acceptance of the terms</h2>
  <p>By using our apps, you (or your parent/guardian) confirm agreement with this policy. If you disagree, please stop using the app and contact us.</p>

  <h2>14. Contact information</h2>
